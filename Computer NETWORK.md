1. **Introduction to Networking**
    - Networking Definition: The practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources.
    - Benefits: Resource sharing, communication, data transfer.

2. **Basic Terminology**
    - **Node**: Any device connected to the network (e.g., computers, printers).
    - **Router**: Connects different networks together.
    - **Switch**: Connects devices within the same network.
    - **Protocol**: Set of rules for communication.
    - **IP Address**: Unique identifier for devices on a network.

3. **Types of Networks**
    - **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Limited to a small geographic area.
    - **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Spans larger distances, often across cities or countries.
    - **Internet**: A global network of networks.

4. **Networking Devices**
    - **Router**: Connects multiple networks and directs data between them.
    - **Switch**: Connects devices within a network, forwarding data based on MAC addresses.
    - **Hub**: Simplest networking device, broadcasts data to all connected devices.
    - **Modem**: Converts digital data from a computer to analog for transmission over phone lines.

5. **OSI Model**
    - **Physical Layer**: Deals with physical connection (cables, connectors).
    - **Data Link Layer**: Manages node-to-node communication (MAC addresses).
    - **Network Layer**: Responsible for routing and logical addressing (IP addresses).
    - **Transport Layer**: Ensures end-to-end communication and data flow control.
    - **Session Layer**: Manages sessions or connections between applications.
    - **Presentation Layer**: Translates data between application and network formats.
    - **Application Layer**: Supports network applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

6. **IP Addressing**
    - **IPv4**: Uses a 32-bit address format.
        - Example: 192.168.1.1
    - **IPv6**: Uses a 128-bit address format.
        - Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

7. **Subnetting**
    - Dividing an IP network into sub-networks for better organization and security.
    - Example: 192.168.1.0/24, where /24 indicates the subnet mask.

8. **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**
    - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
    - Internet Protocol (IP): Responsible for addressing and routing packets.
    - Other Protocols: UDP, ICMP, HTTP, FTP.

9. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
    - Resolves human-readable domain names to IP addresses.
    - Example: www.example.com â†’ 192.168.1.1

10. **Security and Firewalls**
    - Firewalls: Control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
    - VPNs (Virtual Private Networks): Securely extend a private network across a public network.

11. **Wireless Networking**
    - Wi-Fi: Enables wireless network connections.
    - Security: WPA2, WPA3 for secure wireless communication.

12. **Troubleshooting Basics**
    - **Ping**: Tests connectivity to a specific IP address.
    - **Traceroute**: Shows the route that packets take to reach a destination.
    - **IPConfig / Ifconfig**: Displays network configuration details.
