The song "Stressed Out" by Twenty One Pilots reflects on the struggles of growing up and losing the carefree mindset of childhood. The lyrics express a desire to go back to a simpler time when the worries of the world were minor and the comfort of home and family was enough. The lines “Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young, How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?” indicate the longing to reconnect with memories of childhood that seem just out of reach. The chorus, “Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days, When our mama sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out” reinforces the desire to escape the pressures and expectations of adult life.
The song also addresses the insecurities and anxieties that come with growing up. The lines “But now I'm insecure and I care what people think, My name's Blurryface and I care what you think” express the frustration with the constant need for validation as an adult in society. The persona of “Blurryface” represents this self-doubt and the pressure to conform to societal norms. This theme of insecurity is revisited in later lyrics, particularly the lines “Saying, 'Wake up, you need to make money'” which demonstrate the pressure to succeed and fit into a system that values material success above all else.

The song "Stressed Out" by Twenty One Pilots resonates with my life, especially as a computer science and engineering student, due to several key themes:

1. **Pressures of Adulthood**: As a student in a demanding field, you probably face significant stress and expectations. The song’s mention of longing for simpler times and the chorus, “Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days,” might echo your feelings when overwhelmed by academic and career pressures.

2. **Nostalgia for Simplicity**: Like the song’s reflection on childhood memories, you might find yourself reminiscing about less complicated times before the responsibilities of higher education and career planning took precedence.

3. **Insecurities and Validation**: The lines “But now I'm insecure and I care what people think” could relate to the pressure you feel to perform well academically and fit into societal expectations, common for students striving to establish their careers. The persona of “Blurryface” symbolizes these insecurities and societal pressures.

4. **Financial and Career Expectations**: The lyric “Wake up, you need to make money” directly connects to the pressures you face to succeed financially and professionally, a common concern for students preparing to enter the workforce.

By addressing these universal yet deeply personal themes, "Stressed Out" captures the emotional landscape of transitioning from the carefree days of youth to the demanding reality of adult responsibilities, which might mirror your own experiences as you navigate through your studies and future career aspirations.
