Dear Students,  
It was a really interesting semester with you all. Since we may meet or not meet in the upcoming semesters, I have a few suggestions for everyone. So here it goes  
a. Learn C++ from any of the 2 books: Teach Yourself C++(Best for beginners), and The complete reference C++. If you want to learn Java from scratch, [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l4D6UMxqdqfjbUl4wlo1T6LwlgUKQoJY/view?usp=sharing) book is an excellent resource.  
b. Learn javascript at your free time from this book: [https://wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/JavaScript.pdf](https://wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/JavaScript.pdf)  
c. Practice problems from Leetcode, UVA, or Code forces. Start with simple and easy problems and gradually move to advanced problems. This habit alone can help you land jobs at top-tier companies.  
d. Develop small projects using Python. You can take a look at some example projects here: [https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/tree/master/projects](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/tree/master/projects)  
**e. Learn to Google. That will be your biggest friend in the upcoming semesters. Before taking help from anyone, try to solve things by searching google.** f. Please collect CSE220 book from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mhYUK8U6mKGiZNbV9T6p8M1ayKaoFM7H?usp=sharing). I don’t have the lab files. You have to collect them yourself. Start with the following topics: Array (linear and Circular), Stack and Queue, Recursion, Selection sort, Insertion sort, and Key Index searching and sorting. And if you get confident you can move to Linked list.Except for **point f**. You can practice the rest of the points in your free time. But make sure you take it seriously.Suggestions as per your grade, CSE111:  
a. If you secured a grade greater than or equal to 3.3, please start reading the contents of CSE220.  
b. If you secured a grade greater than or equal to 2.7, please revise the contents of CSE110 first, then move to CSE111 and finally do the extra things mentioned previously.  
c. If you scored below 2.7, I would suggest retaking the course.  
d. If you failed in CSE111, start revising CSE110 first. Practice problems from beecrowd. Otherwise, you will lose track of your academics for good. Just focus while studying and practice problems from as many resources as you can. By resources, I mean online judges like Leetcode, UVA. Start at the beginner level, then slowly move to advanced problems. This will help you till CSE221. Trust me, you can do better. Just try to make sense out of what you are studying, and understand the logic slowly but correctly. Passing without creating a strong base is worse than failing.  
e. If you can't really make sense out of the contents of CSE110, if you do not understand the basic logic and have trouble understanding lists, tuples, and dictionaries even after revising the topics, I believe it's high time you think about switching the department. Try to study something you enjoy. You don't have to study CSE, just because someone is forcing you to. Find your interest, focus on that, and eventually, you will do good. If you don’t enjoy CSE but still carrying on just because someone wants you to be a Computer Engineer, at the end of 4 years you will become an Engineer for sure, but not the engineer anyone wants. If you enjoy what you are studying, you can always make a living out of it, might not have an appealing salary at the beginning, but you will be happy for sure and that's what most of the employees of our country lack. I always use my wife as an example. She was a pharmacy student but continued her career in baking because it was her passion, and, MashAllah she is doing well. At first, everyone in her family was against her, but she proved how an individual can flourish if he/she follows his/her passion. If you enjoy your job, that is the best job possible. When your parents get old, they will like to see you happy, not a depressed human sitting on a pile of money.  
I am telling all these to you because you all are young. You have time to decide your career. Do it wisely while you have the chance. Thank you for your wonderful cooperation throughout the semester. Sometimes I was tough on some of you. I am sorry for that, but believe me, it's for your own good. Best of luck in the future. On a different note, if you ever feel like playing Valorant with me, here is my IGN: dev1ce#4402Usually, I play on a 5 stack team, but if you are willing to play, let me know earlier and I will try to manage time for one or two games. Thank you. Regards,
